\section{Problem Description}
Many people, especially students like me, have many tasks they need to finish in a day.
However, an unstructured daily plan can be inefficient: that's where Timeblocking comes in.
Timeblocking is a strategy where you dedicate chunks of time in your day to work on specific tasksâ€”I use timeblocking in my daily life to help keep my tasks under control.
While timeblocking is a powerful strategy, implementing
there's no online program focused on timeblocking: current solutions like Google Calendar make this process difficult and time-consuming.
These apps don't have features that are essential for timeblocking, like an easy way to create a copy of a schedule to resize it
Initially, I considered building a plugin for these apps that would add the additional features, but I eventually learned that they don't expose the necessary functionality for me to fully customize the calendar view.
Thus, I want to create an app from scratch that allows me (and other students!) to easily create a timeblocking schedule that will sync between multiple devices.

\section{Proposed Solution}
My app, Timeblocker, will provide an interface that allows students to add tasks to a daily timeblocking schedule.
My app will contain two parts: task boxes and a schedule. The boxes will represent tasks, and the user will be able to drag the boxes onto the schedule, where they'll be able to resize the boxes to fit the time on the schedule during when they would like to work on it. The user can create and reuse task blocks, so that they don't need to create a separate event each time.

Each task block will have a title (the name of the task), a description, and extra information based on the box type.
There will be multiple types of boxes, such as a school based box, an entertainment box, etc.
Thus, this will need the use of inheritance (SchoolTaskBox extends TaskBox).

The app will also allow the user the ability to import and export their schedules as a file.
In addition, users will have the ability to create an account to synchronize their schedules across different computers.

I'm building this app in TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript that compiles to JavaScript) because I want this app to be as accessible as possible.
Since TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, a programming language that all browser support, users will be able to access my app from any device with a browser:
all they need to do is visit the website \href{https://ib.timeblocker.io}{timeblocker.io}\footnote{For my IB submission, I'm deploying the site under the URL https://ib.timeblocker.io in case I wish to make changes to the site on the original domain. I'll also be including a pre-built version of the website in the code linked to the title page as well.}.
In addition, I'll also be building the server in TypeScript:
by building the frontend and backend in the same language, I'll be able to share code between the frontend and backend which enables me to use powerful libraries like tRPC that automatically read the backend's routes to create type-safe functions.
I decided to use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript because TypeScript's strongly-typed guarantees help eliminate many type errors at compile-time (e.g., typos, passing wrong types to functions, calling non-existent class methods).

\section{Success Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create, edit, and delete tasks
	\item Drag tasks onto the schedule to create task blocks
	\item Creating multiple timeblocks
	\item Searching through task boxes
	\item Resizing the task boxes that are on the schedule
	\item Changing the schedule view between day and week
	\item Registering and logging into accounts
	\item Server-side synchronization with a database to access schedules across devices
	\item Exporting the timeblock as a file
	\item Schedule autosaves every time changes are made
\end{itemize}

\section{Target Market}
The target market of this software is people that are looking to schedule their day in a way that saves them time and helps them get more done in a day.

	\hline
	\textbf{Mastery Factor}
	& \textbf{Where it would be used}
	\\\hline
	1. Arrays
	& Array of tasks in the schedule
	\\\hline
	2. User-defined objects
	& A list of task boxes
	\\\hline
	3. Objects as data records
	& Task box details (title, description, etc.)
	\\\hline
	4. Simple selection (if-else)
	& When the user creates a task, an if statement is used to check if the task name is empty, and if so, cancels creating the task (since a task's name can't be empty).
	\\\hline
	5. Complex selection (nested if, if with multiple conditions or switch)
	& When the user has selected the type of task to create, I use a switch statement when initializing the correct class instance for the type of task the user is creating.
	\\\hline
	6. Loops
	& Looping through all the task blocks that need to be created on the client-side when the list of the user's task blocks are returned from the server.
	\\\hline
	7. User-defined methods
	& The onDrop method that gets called whenever a user drops a task onto the schedule.
	\\\hline
	8. User-defined methods with appropriate return values
	& A method that returns the color based on the type of task so that the different types of tasks are colour-coded.
	\\\hline
	9. Sorting
	& Sorting of task boxes in the preview based on the task names.
	\\\hline
	10. Searching
	& Searching through task boxes based on the name/description.
	\\\hline
	11. Use of additional libraries
	& I will be using various industry-standard frontend and backend development tools and libraries for making development easier. The main ones are Vue.js (a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces) for the frontend, and Fastify (a fast Node.js web framework) for the backend. See Appendix for a complete list of third-party libraries used in Timeblocker.

	\hline
	\textbf{Mastery Factor}
	& \textbf{Where it would be used}
	\\\hline
	1. Polymorphism
	& The different types of task blocks and task boxes will have the same method signatures but have different functionality, and I use polymorphism to invoke the unique functionality of each task block.
	\\\hline
	2. Inheritance
	& Specific types of tasks and task blocks (fixed weekly task and fixed weekly time tasks) inherit from the Task and TaskBlock base classes.
	\\\hline
	3. Encapsulation
	& The classes will only expose getters and setters that retrieve private properties on classes. The setters will validate the input to make sure that the new value set on the class instance is valid.
	\\\hline
	4. Database
	& Timeblocker will be using PostgreSQL as the database, using Prisma as the ORM for type-safety with TypeScript.
